#find searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating the expression from left to right
#you can skim the man page to get an idea of what it's doingthere's an EXAMPLES section at the bottom
#http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

#To test if you are finding all you need do this:
find . -wholename "*/wf_taxa_summary/otu_table_ns_L5.txt" -exec echo {} append \;
	#Echo tells it back to you
	#{} is the file name

Then create the directory you wish to copy the files to - ex: combined_data
	
find . -wholename "*/wf_taxa_summary/otu_table_ns_L5.txt" -exec cp {} combined_L5 \;
	#this time instead of echoing back it will copy the files to a folder you created and specified





find . -wholename "*/wf_taxa_summary/otu_table_ns_L5.txt" -exec append {} combined_L5/test.txt \;
