bioinfoscripts
==============

A collection of small tools and scripts that have resulted from helping some biologists deal with their data and teaching them a little about the tools available.  

Mostly python, some bash, smattering of other languages. Scripts are quite rough, unlikely to be useful for any purposes beyond their initial use; the intent is to bang them into general purpose use as I see similar situations crop up. 

(Note that the complexity of code and level of commenting varies widely; some scripts are for quickly solving tasks, others are pair-written as a learning exercise)
